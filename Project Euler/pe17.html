        <p>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.</p>
        <p>If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? </p>
        <br><p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. <br> The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</p>
