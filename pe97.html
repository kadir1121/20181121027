        <p>The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2
            <sup>6972593</sup>−1; <br> it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the 
            form 2<sup><i>p</i></sup>−1, have been found which contain more digits.</p>
        <p>However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×2<sup>7830457</sup>+1.</p>
        <p>Find the last ten digits of this prime number.</p>
